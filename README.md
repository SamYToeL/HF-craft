# HF-craft
In the jupyter notebook there is a basic and coarse hartree-fock iteration for H2 molecule;

molecule integrals are data for 1.4Angs from Szabo & Ostlund.

May update the molecular integrals part afterwards.


In the "Cpp project"
project3 a HF for water molecule in STO-3G is written following the instructions of Prof. D. Crawford at https://github.com/CrawfordGroup/ProgrammingProjects/tree/master.
Still calculations of molecular integrals are skipped.
